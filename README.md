<h1>I have created this program as project for my class 12th IP subject</h1>
<br>
In this program I use python amd python's lib like <b>pandas</b> for DataFrame and <b>pymysql</b> and <b>sqlalchemy</b> to connect python with Mysql<br>
In this i have used while loop and if-else statement to create a Logic that makes sure user that s/he is entering correct infomation as the progrma will not more futher until user enter correct information<br>
 <h2>Improvements in the future</h2>
 <b>As the progrm is not completely user friendly so the following update in the future</b><br>
*Adding logic in dob secion as there is no logic for dob currently .<br>
*Going to give user power to change database .<br> 
*Going to give user power to change or create new Table .<br>
*Giving power to user to set his/her own DataBase schema .<br>


<h2>Some Advance Update</h2>
<b>As the connection btw python and mysql is set in the progrma so .</b><br>
*Going to create a new python program which stabilize the connection between python and mysql .<br>
*The program will take password of mysql and database name where the action will perform from user .<br>
*Program wiil also take info about the user and store it so user dont have to fill his/her details every time s/he uses main program .<br>
*All the info will be Stored in .txt file in some dir which can be change my setup program and used by my main progrma.
